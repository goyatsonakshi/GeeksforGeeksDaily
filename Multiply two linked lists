Multiply two linked lists
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 46.33%Submissions: 69K+Points: 2
Given elements as nodes of the two singly linked lists. The task is to multiply these two linked lists, say L1 and L2.

Note: The output could be large take modulo 10^9+7.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList L1 : 3->2 , LinkedList L2 : 2
Output: 64
Explanation: 

Multiplication of 32 and 2 gives 64.
Input: LinkedList L1: 1->0->0 , LinkedList L2 : 1->0
Output: 1000
Explanation: 

Multiplication of 100 and 10 gives 1000.
Expected Time Complexity: O(max(n,m))
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)
where n is the size of L1 and m is the size of L2

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 <= node->data <= 103
